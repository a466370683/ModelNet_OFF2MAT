This code can be used to generate voxelized 3D mat files  with different views from ModelNet10 or 40. 



---

* PARAMETERS:

volume_size: the output volume size is 300×300×300

angle_inc:   the multiview images are generated based on equal angle-interval sampling, the total num of images from one .OFF is 360/angle_inc

off_path:    the path of ModelNet10

mat_path:    the path of output voxelized mat files



* USAGE：

For ModelNet10, you can directly run ModelNet10_off2mat.m

For ModelNet40, you can directly run ModelNet40_off2mat.m
